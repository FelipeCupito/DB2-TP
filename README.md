# Pixie - FastAPI Web API Application with Docker
Pixie is a project that utilizes FastAPI and Docker to create and run a web API application. The following instructions will guide you through setting up and running the project in your local environment.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, make sure you have the following programs installed on your machine:
- Docker: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Python 3.11: [Installation Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
## Setup Instructions
Grant execution permissions to the setup scripts:
```bash
cd BD2-TP
chmod +x setup.sh
```

## Running the application
To run the application, follow these steps. Please note that each application (bank1, bank2, and pixie) needs to be executed in different terminals:
1. Run the setup.sh script to add necessary permissions, build the Docker images, and run the containers:
```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```
2. Open a new terminal and run the `run_bank1.sh` script to start **bank1**:
```bash
 ./run_bank1.sh
```
This will start the **bank1** application on port 8080.

3. Open another terminal and run the `run_bank2.sh` script to start **bank2**:
```bash
 ./run_bank2.sh
```
This will start the **bank 2** application on port 8090.

4. Finally, open one more terminal and run the `run_pixie.sh` script to start **Pixie**:
```bash
 ./run_pixie.sh
```
This will start the pixie application on port 8000.

## Stopping the application
To stop the application execution, simply press Ctrl + C in the terminal where the application is running. This will stop the FastAPI development server.

## Additional Notes
To change the port of the applications, navigate to the corresponding `run_bank1.sh`, `run_bank2.sh`, or `run_pixie.sh` file. Inside the file, you'll find a line similar to `python3 main.py 8080 5432 "data/user1.json"`. Change the value of the first parameter passed to main.py to modify the port. For example, if you want bank 1 to run on port 8081, modify the file to `python3 main.py 8081 5432 "data/user1.json"`.
